# interview

Project used for interviewing Android developers. There are two challenges in the project
1. The first challenge is to update layouts to make a page look like the Challenge_1_Example.png
2. The second challenge is to see if the candidate understands the callback pattern for calling async services and updating a view on response as well as understanding the headless fragment "solution" to manage the callback for Android lifecycles during events like screen rotations.
